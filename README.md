This is a next project showcasing the [openapi-for-humans OpenAPI Explorer](https://github.com/CodeFromAnywhere/openapi-for-humans-react).

Goals:

- Make URL contain state
- Make operations of predefined openapis statically generated
- A friendly UI to use multiple products defined by OpenAPIs without looking to technical
- Ability to use crawl agents that can build action-paths based on the openapis and a query.
- Ability to use this repo as a template so people can deploy a frontend for their own openapi with customised settings, and easily extend it in any way.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
